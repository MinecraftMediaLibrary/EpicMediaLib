# Contributions to the EpicMediaLib Project

I welcome all contributors! Contributors are awesome. They allow me to realize that I am not the only one that is alone
working on this project and I have support from other people. Contributing is very easy. You navigate to the Pull Requests
section and create a new Pull Request there. However, there are some guidelines for such contributions.

## Three Mighty Rules

1) Be Appropriate
  - Make sure the contribution being proposed is appropriate. Appropriate as in reasonable. If it is not appropriate, I
    may ask a comment about the pull request to investigate further.
    
2) Code Quality
  - Your code quality should be somewhat decent. By decent, I am asking for code which follows Object Oriented Programming,
    follows the pillars, avoids DRY code, etc. Code should also avoid legacy/deprecated api if possible. I can try and help
    re-code some parts if it is necessary, but you should be making sure that the code being added to the library is good
    enough for library standards.
    
3) Code Formatting
  - MinecraftMediaLibrary follows the Google Code Format for Java. If that isn't applied to your pull request, I can help
    apply the format for you. However, if you do it already, I will be super happy :^).

And that's pretty much it! Just follow these rules and you will be contributing in no time. I am super nice for pull requests
so if it is your first pull request, I completely understand. Good luck to all of you programmers!
