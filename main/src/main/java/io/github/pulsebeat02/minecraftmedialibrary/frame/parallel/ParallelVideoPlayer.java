/**
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * Suppose we had two separate threads:
 *
 * Thread #1: Dithers a specific frame.
 * Thread #2: Sends the dithered frame data to the clients.
 *
 * Frame # | What to do:
 * --------|-------------------------------------
 * 1       | Thread #1 dithers this frame.
 * 2       | Thread #2 sends out frame number 1, while Thread #1 dithers frame number 2.
 * 3       | Thread #2 sends out frame number 2, while Thread #1 dithers frame number 3.
 *
 * And so on, (chaining domino pattern)
 *
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The issue however with one thread is blocking. If the dithered results aren't ready,
 * this means that thread #2 has to be blocked from thread #1 to wait for the send the
 * dithered results to clients. This will significantly slow the video speed and affect
 * the frames being sent per second.
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * We could split this into more threads based on the user's environment. For example:
 *
 * Thread #1 ... #2: Dithers a specific frame. (We can dither 2 frames at once since
 * we have 2 threads now instead of just 1)
 * Thread #3: Sends the dithered frame data to the clients.
 *
 * Frame # | What to do:
 * --------|-------------------------------------
 * 1       | Thread #1 and #2 dithers this frame at the same time.
 * 2       | Thread #3 sends the dithered frame provided from thread #1/#2.
 * | Thread #1/#2 now dithers frame 2.
 *
 *
 * And so on, (chaining domino pattern) The advantage of having two threads dither is
 * that the result may be faster toreceive due to the parallel computations made on
 * the frame dithering. This will mean that the chance of blocking will likely less
 * occur due to how in an ideal environment (where it can support multiple threads
 * running at once at a good pace), it can provide the results faster.
 *
 * Since the actual dithering process will be made async/in parallel, encapsulate
 * the result in a Future&lt;int[]&gt;
 *
 * Have a FrameSender class (or whatever you wanna call it) with a Queue&lt;Future&lt;int[]&gt;&gt;,
 * I believe a LinkedList is the best option here
 *
 * Add the future data to the FrameSender queue orderly before/when the dithering starts
 * (not after it finishes, kinda defeats the purpose of using Futures here), then start
 * the process in parallel. That way, no matter when the frame is processed, since you
 * put them in order as they come in, they will be in order when you retrieve them
 *
 * In the sender, so long so it isn't empty, remove() the frame and Futures.getUnchecked(frame)
 * the data and send it, that way it will be sent as soon as it's done (basically blocking
 * the sender thread before sending it until the frame is processed; hopefully, them being
 * processed in parallel will keep them up and overcome any waiting overhead) (the class is
 * from Guava, it just wraps the checked Future#get() exceptions in an unchecked exception/error)
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * This is currently a VideoPlayer in progress. It will not function at all. Please wait as I try to
 * develop it.
